## Instralling pre-requisites

There are a number of pre-requisites needed to run Postal. These are detailed [in the documentation](https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites). If you're feeling a bit lazy (or just doing a lot of testing) , we have a couple of scripts which you can use to install everything needed.
